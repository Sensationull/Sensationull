### Hello, I'm Andrew 👋🏾

I am a Frontend Software Engineer with experience in Javascript: (React, Redux, Node) and have way more fun debugging CSS than people recommend.  I'm always looking to learn about other cultures and their experiences with code! When I'm not coding (and often when I am), I am listening to all different kinds of music or outside getting some sun!
